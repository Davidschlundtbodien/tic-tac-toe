# Tic-Tac-Toe
## [Coming soon]()

### Summary
  Classic Tic-tac-toe with a beer vs wine theme. Application keeps track of wins and game progression through utilization of local storage.

### How it Works
  Each player takes turns placing thier icon on the board, the messages above the board displays who's turn it is and whether there is a win or draw. Upon win or draw the player who did not go first will do so in the next game. 
  
### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

### Future Additions
- Choice of Icons used
- Better layout for larger screens
- Sounds played on win and draw condition

### Known Bugs
- If user refreshs screen upon winning (before starting a new game), it may duplicate the score to be added to that players wins.
